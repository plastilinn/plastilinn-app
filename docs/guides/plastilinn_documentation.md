The Ghostbusters' business model revolves around providing a niche service of paranormal investigation and elimination. Their target customers are individuals, businesses, and public institutions experiencing supernatural disturbances. They charge fees for capturing and containing ghosts, offering customized solutions based on the severity and complexity of the haunting.

    this sidebar. Click on the button "🤖 Get suggestions from AI assistant," and a message will indicate that the

    in a new window, paste (CTRL+V) the prompt, wait for a response, and copy/paste it into the "Problems" section of
    your document. Review the response and make any modifications you deem appropriate.
