The Ghostbusters' business model revolves around providing a niche service of paranormal investigation and elimination. Their target customers are individuals, businesses, and public institutions experiencing supernatural disturbances. They charge fees for capturing and containing ghosts, offering customized solutions based on the severity and complexity of the haunting.

Artificial intelligence can suggest content to complete each section of the document. For example, let's focus on the

    this sidebar. Click on the button "🤖 Get suggestions from AI assistant," and a message will indicate that the
    document's content has been copied to your clipboard. Then use the "Open" button to open the Plastilinn AI Assistant
    in a new window, paste (CTRL+V) the prompt, wait for a response, and copy/paste it into the "Problems" section of
    your document. Review the response and make any modifications you deem appropriate.
