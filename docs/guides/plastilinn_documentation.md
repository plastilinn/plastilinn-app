## ☑️ Getting started


#### Describe your business

Write a 1-2 paragraph description of your business idea in the "Business summary" section of the document. Click on the "Business summary" button below to navigate to the "Business summary" section of the document.

Edit the 🆔 [Business summary](#business-summary) block

Write your own business description or copy/paste the text in the textarea below in case you're just playing around with plastilinn.


The Ghostbusters' business model revolves around providing a niche service of paranormal investigation and elimination. Their target customers are individuals, businesses, and public institutions experiencing supernatural disturbances. They charge fees for capturing and containing ghosts, offering customized solutions based on the severity and complexity of the haunting.


#### Let AI suggest ideas

Artificial intelligence can suggest content to complete each section of the document. For example, let's focus on the "Problems" section (the one that describes the problems your customers face and that your business can help solve).


Once you click the button below, information related to this specific section ("Problems") will appear at the top of this sidebar. Click on the button "🤖 Get suggestions from AI assistant," and a message will indicate that the document's content has been copied to your clipboard. Then use the "Open" button to open the Plastilinn AI Assistant in a new window, paste (CTRL+V) the prompt, wait for a response, and copy/paste it into the "Problems" section of your document. Review the response and make any modifications you deem appropriate.
